			<div class="ingredients">
				<ul>
					<li> 6 oz  Penne Rigate Pasta</li>
					<li>½ cup  Part-Skim Ricotta Cheese</li>
					<li>2 cloves  Garlic</li>
					<li>1 bunch  Kale</li>
					<li>1  Delicata Squash</li>
					<li>2 Tbsps  Butter</li>
					<li>¼ tsp  Crushed Red Pepper Flakes</li>
					<li>2 Tbsps  Spreadable Goat Cheese</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="method">
				<ol>
					<li>Preheat the oven to 450°F. Heat a large pot of salted water to boiling on high. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Wash and dry the squash; cut off and discard the ends. Quarter lengthwise; using a spoon, scoop out and discard the pulp and seeds. Cut the squash crosswise into ½-inch-thick pieces. Place on the prepared sheet pan. Top with a drizzle of olive oil and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Season with salt and pepper; toss to thoroughly coat. Arrange in a single layer. Roast 24 to 26 minutes, or until lightly browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven; set aside in a warm place.</li>
					<li>While the squash roasts, peel and roughly chop the garlic. Wash and dry the kale. Remove and discard the stems; roughly chop the leaves. In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and a drizzle of olive oil; season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
					<li>While the squash continues to roast, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook 11 to 13 minutes, or until just shy of al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Turn off the heat. Reserving ½ cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly and return to the pot.</li>
					<li>While the pasta cooks, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the kale and ¼ cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 4 to 5 minutes, or until the kale has wilted and the water has cooked off. Turn off the heat; season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
					<li>Add the roasted squash, cooked kale, butter, and half the reserved pasta cooking water to the pot of cooked pasta. Cook on medium-high, stirring vigorously, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thoroughly combined and the pasta is coated. (If the sauce seems dry, gradually add the remaining pasta cooking water to achieve your desired consistency.) Turn off the heat; stir in the goat cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
